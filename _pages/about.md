## Hello World!
I'm a neuroengineer enthusiastic about computer vision, machine learning and open-source softwares.
My general research interests include associate artificial intelligence with neural data processing. Check out some of the 
[projects](https://tuliofalmeida.github.io/projects/) I've been working on or [follow me](https://twitter.com/tuliofalmeida) on twitter!
 
## What am I up to?
I'm currently work as technical support at Edmond and Lily Safra International Institute of Neuroscience ([IIN-ELS](http://www.institutosantosdumont.org.br/en/unidade/edmond-and-lily-safra-international-institute-of-neurosciences/)) under the guidance of Dr. Abner Rodrigues. 
I received my M.Sc. in Neuroengineering from the IIN-ELS, where I worked with Dr. Andr√© Dantas and Dr. Abner Rodrigues developing a open-source system for measuring and analyzing data from inertial sensors, fully availabe in [PyJAMA](https://github.com/tuliofalmeida/pyjama). Throughout my M.Sc. I became interested in research electrophysiological data and animal behavior, developing [PyRAT](https://github.com/pyratlib/pyrat), an open source python library to process tracking data.
<br>    
When I'm not working, I enjoy read, play sports and online games.
