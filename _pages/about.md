## Hello World!

I'm a neuroengineer enthusiastic about neuroscience, computer vision, machine learning and open-source softwares.
My general research interests include associate artificial intelligence with neural data processing. Check out some of the 
[projects](https://tuliofalmeida.github.io/projects/) I've been working on or [follow me](https://twitter.com/tuliofalmeida) on twitter!
 
## What am I up to?

I'm part of the Pre-Doc + PhD program of the Initiative for interdisciplinary research in Biology ([i-Bio](http://ibio.sorbonne-universite.fr/)) of [Sorbonne University](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/). I will be doing rotations in three different laboratories at the [Institut de Biologie Paris-Seine](https://www.ibps.sorbonne-universite.fr/en) and the [Institut du Fer à Moulin](https://ifm-institute.org/en/home/) at the Sorbonne University:

1. Project title “Leveraging machine learning and neural field modeling to understand the role of REM sleep in emotional memory consolidation and homeostasis”. Supervisors Gabrielle Girardeau (IFM - [Girardeau Lab](https://girardeaulab.org/)) & Wilten Nicola (University of Calgary)
2. Project title “Regulation of gene expression coupled to cell growth and division in bacterial adaption processes” Supervisors Bianca Sclavi (Laboratory of Computational and Quantitative Biology, IBPS) & Marco Cosentino Lagomarsino (IFOM foundation, University of Milan)
3. Project title “Dissecting how excitable ependymal cells participate to locomotor rhythms using an all-optical approach” Supervisors Jean-Marie Mangin (Neurosciences Paris Seine, IBPS) & Georges Debregeas (Laboratory Jean Perrin, IBPS)

I'm currently at [Laboratory of Computational and Quantitative Biology, IBPS](https://www.ibps.sorbonne-universite.fr/en/research/computational-and-quantitative-biology/genome-biology)!

## Before PhD

I received my M.Sc. in Neuroengineering from the Edmond and Lily Safra International Institute of Neuroscience ([IIN-ELS](http://www.institutosantosdumont.org.br/en/unidade/edmond-and-lily-safra-international-institute-of-neurosciences/)), where I worked with Dr. André Dantas and Dr. Abner Rodrigues developing a open-source system for measuring and analyzing data from inertial sensors, fully availabe in [PyJAMA](https://github.com/tuliofalmeida/pyjama). Throughout my M.Sc. I became interested in research electrophysiological data and animal behavior, developing [PyRAT](https://github.com/pyratlib/pyrat), an open source python library to process tracking data. Also, after finishing my master's degree, I received a technical support scholarship to work at the IIN-ELS under the guidance of Dr. Abner Rodrigues, using connectivity techniques to analyze electrophysiological data from rats during epletic seizures.
