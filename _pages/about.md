## Hello World!

I'm a neuroengineer enthusiastic about neuroscience, computer vision, machine learning and open-source softwares.
My general research interests include associate artificial intelligence with neural data processing. Check out some of the 
[projects](https://tuliofalmeida.github.io/projects/) I've been working on or [follow me](https://twitter.com/tuliofalmeida) on twitter!
 
## What am I up to?

I will start in the Pre-Doc + PhD program of the Initiative for interdisciplinary research in Biology ([i-Bio](http://ibio.sorbonne-universite.fr/)) of Sorbonne University in October of 2022. During the first year I will do rotations in three labs with different projects, and after that continue the development of one of these projects. 

## Before PhD

I received my M.Sc. in Neuroengineering from the Edmond and Lily Safra International Institute of Neuroscience ([IIN-ELS](http://www.institutosantosdumont.org.br/en/unidade/edmond-and-lily-safra-international-institute-of-neurosciences/)), where I worked with Dr. Andr√© Dantas and Dr. Abner Rodrigues developing a open-source system for measuring and analyzing data from inertial sensors, fully availabe in [PyJAMA](https://github.com/tuliofalmeida/pyjama). Throughout my M.Sc. I became interested in research electrophysiological data and animal behavior, developing [PyRAT](https://github.com/pyratlib/pyrat), an open source python library to process tracking data. Also, after finishing my master's degree, I received a technical support scholarship to work at the IIN-ELS under the guidance of Dr. Abner Rodrigues, using connectivity techniques to analyze electrophysiological data from rats during epletic seizures.
