# Advanced Computational Analysis for Behavioral and Neurophysiological Recordings

The [i-Bio Summer School](http://ibio.sorbonne-universite.fr/seminars-summer-schools/) was held in [Banyuls-sur-Mer](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&sca_esv=599184041&sxsrf=ACQVn09Nzm-LxigfKo-l1Al1FVsJ5yFKfA:1705513188709&q=Banyuls-sur-Mer&tbm=isch&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjB85be--SDAxXkUaQEHR4DDs0Q0pQJegQICxAB&biw=2560&bih=1307&dpr=1#imgrc=wAmDu1B9fu9sIM) from August 6th to August 12th, 2023. The summer school focused on providing theoretical and practical exposure to computational tools used in modern neuroscience to interpret high-dimensional neurophysiological and behavioral signals associated with complex behaviors. The practicals were organized into two groups that worked on different datasets. I had the opportunity to be a teacher assistant in the group that worked on electrophysiological recordings performed in the hippocampus and the amygdala while the animal performed a navigation task and during subsequent periods of sleep. We prepared tutorials in MATLAB that taught how to estimate tuning curves, fit generalized linear models, decode from spike train data, detect cell assemblies, perform cross-correlation analyses, and conduct time-frequency analyses. The code and dataset are available in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/i-Bio-Summer-School-2023/Practicals-ratgroup). We also started to develop a version in Python (in this [repository](https://github.com/tuliofalmeida/Practicals-ratgroup)), but only the load functions have been completed so far. To develop the tutorials, we used only one part of a dataset. The full version is available [online](https://crcns.org/data-sets/hc/hc-14/about-hc-14), and the reference paper is [Girardeau et al., 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.4637).
